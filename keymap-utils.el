;;; Editing Keymaps

(defmacro kmu-edit-keymap (mapvar feature &rest args)
  "Define all keys in ARGS in the keymap stored in MAPVAR.

MAPVAR is a variable whose value is a keymap.  If FEATURE is nil,
then that keymap is modified immediately.  If FEATURE is a symbol
or string, then the keymap isn't modified until after that
library/file has been loaded.  The FEATURE has to be specified if
it isn't always loaded and MAPVAR does not exist until after it
has been loaded.

The simplest form ARGS can take is (KEY DEF ...), but see below
for details.

Each KEY is a string that satisfies `key-valid-p'.

Each DEF can be anything that can be a key's definition according
to `keymap-set'.

A DEF can also be the symbol `:remove' in which case the KEY's
existing definition (if any) is removed (not just unset) from
KEYMAP using `keymap-unset' with t as the value of the REMOVE
argument.

The symbol `>' is a synonym for `:remove', which is useful when
you want to move a binding from one key to another and make that
explicit:

  (keymap-edit foo-mode-map foo
    \"a\" > \"b\" moved-command)

A DEF can also be the symbol `=' in which case the binding of the
preceding KEY is *not* changed.  This is useful when you want to
make it explicit that an existing binding is kept when creating a
new binding:

  (keymap-edit foo-mode-map foo
    \"a\" = \"b\" copied-command)

Finally the symbol `_' can appear anywhere in ARGS and this macro
just treats it as whitespace.  This is useful because it allows
aligning keys and commands without having to fight the automatic
indentation mechanism:

  (keymap-edit foo-mode-map foo
    \"a\" > \"b\" moved-command
    _     \"c\" newly-bound-command)"
